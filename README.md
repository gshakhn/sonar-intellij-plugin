Introduction
-----------

This is the unofficial [IntelliJ IDEA] plugin for [Sonar]. There was a plugin called [SONAR IDE], but it's development for [IntelliJ IDEA] has been discontinued with IntelliJ 9. Therefore I decided to write [my own plugin] which experienced multiple contributions from the IDEA community on Github.

[IntelliJ IDEA]: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
[Sonar]: http://www.sonarsource.org/
[SONAR IDE]: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/IntelliJ+IDEA+Plugin
[my own plugin]: https://github.com/gshakhn/sonar-intellij-plugin

Download
--------

You can install the plugin through the official JetBrains repo. You can also manually download it [here].

[here]: http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pr=idea&pluginId=7168

Building the plugin
------------------

To build the plugin on your machine you need to have at least a downloaded copy of IntelliJ 12.0.4 (Build 123.169).
The plugin depends on multiple jars of IntelliJ IDEA but as these are not available via Maven Central, you'll have to
install the various Intellij jars located in the lib folder of your IntelliJ install into your local Maven repository.

For your convienience we created a bash script which will do exactly this for you
```
    $ cd sonar-intellij-plugin/
    $ ./install-intellij-libs.sh 12.0.4 <path to IntelliJ 12.0.4>
```

To run the maven build you'll also need to install an updated version of [ideauidesigner-maven-plugin]. See that readme for installation instructions.
[ideauidesigner-maven-plugin]: https://github.com/gshakhn/ideauidesigner-maven-plugin

After you install all the jars this plugin needs into your local repo, just run

    mvn package

The resulting zip file will be located in the target folder.


Using the plugin
------------------

1. Go to  File > Project Settings > Modules > Your Module > Sonar Configuration.
2. Enter your host and username/password if required.
3. Click the Load Projects button.
4. Select the Sonar project associated with the module and hit OK.
5. Open the Sonar tab at the bottom.
6. Navigate to a Java file that has violations.
7. Assuming everything is configured correctly, you should see the violations show up in the table.


Usability Notes
------------------
- The violation list and source code for a Java file are cached. If the violation is fixed and another Sonar analysis is complete, IntelliJ will have to be restarted in order for the violation to disappear in IntelliJ.
- There is very little error handling for a bad configuration.


Changelog
---------
