This sample project was introduced for future functional testing. It is still bit of experimental.


The dryRun.json was produced by sonar runner on the 'pomidoro_sample' source.  And the sample will be used in unit/functional testing.

The java files are named java.txt because intelliJ tries to compile them which in this case (yet) don't want.
